        <h2>Additonal Help Resources</h2>
        <p class="description">
          We have learned a lot about HTML and CSS in class this year. Another website I would recommend is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="blank">Udemy</a> because I used it over the summer to not only learn HTML and CSS, but a variety of other languages and information in the CS department. They have a variety of free online courses ranging in all topics.</p>
